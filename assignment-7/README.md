## Trailblazer

Implemented dijkstra, A* and random maze generation using DSU.

The program can output solutions and mazes as pictures (.ppm), as well as drawing solutions in the terminal.

Written from scratch using STL, no GUI support due to time constraints (and the fact that it wasn't the main point of the assignment).

Execute `mkdir demo && cat demo.txt | ./main` for quick test.
